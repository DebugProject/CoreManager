NOTICE:

  These instructions assume you're installing to a server where you have direct control of the OS.
  Whether physically or via an RDP/VNC connection.  If you are installing to a server without direct
  control, you may want to perform steps 2 through 7 first.

INSTALLATION:

   1. Copy the contents of the \CoreManager\ directory into your webserver's www or htdocs directory.
      (If you're NOT planning on using CoreManager as your primary website, copy the entire directory)
      To save transfer time, you may skip the following directories: doc, outdated, and Tools.

   2. Extract all 5 of \img\icons\*_icons.part*.rar into \img\icons\.

   3. Extract any .zip files in \img\icons\updates\ into \img\icons\.

   4. Extract \img\arena_emblems\*_arena_emblems.zip into \img\arena_emblems\.

   5. Extract any .zip files in \img\arena_emblems\updates into \img\arena_emblems\.

   6. Extract \img\emblems\*_emblems.zip into \img\emblems\.

   7. Extract any .zip files in \img\emblems\updates into \img\emblems\.

   8. Create a new database for CoreManager's Configuration data.

   9. Create a new database for CoreManager DBC data.

      (this may take a while as it's populating the CoreManager & DBC Databases)

  19. It will take you to the ACP Login Screen.
      You'll be told you don't have permission; IN THIS CASE, IT IS ACTUALLY OK.
      Just log in using the account you selected in setup.php for Admin Account.
