   2. Create a new database for CoreManager's Configuration data.

   3. Create a new database for CoreManager DBC data.
    (optional, you can use the one you just created for the configs if you like)

   4. Import from the highest numbered *_CoreManager.sql (where * is some number) in \SQL\ to the CoreManager
    Database you just created.  (Ignore all files in \SQL\outdated\)

   5. Import from the highest numbered *_CoreManager_dbc.sql (where * is some number) in \SQL\ to the CoreManager
    DBC Database you just created.  (Ignore all files in \SQL\outdated\)

   6. Starting with the next higher number from the one of the *_CoreManager.sql file you used above,
    apply all the .sql files in \SQL\updates\CoreManager_database_updates\ to your CoreManager Database.

   7. Starting with the next higher number from the one of the *_CoreManager_dbc.sql file you used above, apply
