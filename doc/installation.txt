      To save transfer time, you may skip the following directories: doc, outdated, and Tools.

   2. Create a new database for CoreManager's Configuration data.

   3. Create a new database for CoreManager DBC data.
      (optional: you can use the one you just created for the configs if you like)

   4. Import from *_coremanager.sql (where * is some number) in \SQL\ to the CoreManager
      Database you just created.  (Ignore all files in \SQL\outdated\)

   5. Import from *_coremanager_dbc.sql (where * is some number) in \SQL\ to the CoreManager
      DBC Database you just created.  (Ignore all files in \SQL\outdated\)

   6. Starting with the next higher number from the one of the *_coremanager.sql file you used above,
      apply all the .sql files in \SQL\updates\coremanager_database_updates\ to your CoreManager Database.

   7. Starting with the next higher number from the one of the *_coremanager_dbc.sql file you used above,
      apply all the .sql files in \SQL\updates\coremanager_dbc_database_updates\ to your CoreManager
