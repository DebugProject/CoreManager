Q: I'm getting this message:
  Fatal error: Call to undefined function error() in /XXXX/coremanager/libs/db_lib/mysql.php on line 46
    or
  Error - Connection to database is not established !
  
A: Most likely you've made a mistake in the database configuration your provided for CoreManager.
  Please note: For usernames and passwords MySQL is case sensitive.


Q: Why is the Character Sheet page incomplete or garbled?

A: Because your Game Server isn't saving all of Character Data we need.
  For ArcEmu: Set SaveExtendedCharData to "1".
  For MaNGOS/Trinity: Set PlayerSave.Stats.MinLevel to 1.
