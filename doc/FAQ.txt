Q: I'm getting this message:
  Fatal error: Call to undefined function error() in /XXXX/coremanager/libs/db_lib/mysql.php on line 46
    or
  Error - Connection to database is not established !
  
A: Most likely you've made a mistake in the database configuration your provided for CoreManager.
